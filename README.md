# üè® Hotel Manager

Hotel Manager is a database program designed to manage hotel bookings efficiently. Users, such as hotel managers, can easily create, list, modify and delete bookings. The base class, Hotel, contains the constructors needed to create a booking and destructors required to free up memory. The two sub-classes, Chelsea and Fairmont, represent the two available hotels to create a booking at. Each subclass is derived from the base class.

Depending on which hotel the booking is at, a pointer to their object will be stored in an array of objects of the same type. Every booking object has 4 attributes: floor, unit number, name, and phone number, which are assigned upon creating the object. The user may enter an integer to select the command they want to perform. To adhere to a user-friendly interface, a header for the specified command will be printed. The user may then follow the on-screen instructions to make their inputs. Inputs are validated immediately, and exceptions are thrown as needed. Appropriate error messages will be displayed to the user.

Once the user wishes to exit the program, all used memory will be freed to prevent memory leakage.

This program uses a layered architectural pattern and utilizes classes, polymorphism, pointers, and exceptions. Written in C++ as a final project for ICS4U1.
